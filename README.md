# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

# Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

Welcome to the case study on analyzing customer churn in Power BI! This case study guides you through the process of analyzing customer churn within a fictitious telecom provider named Databel. Led by instructor Iason, you'll apply your skills in Power BI to solve real-world problems and gain valuable insights into customer behavior.

## Overview

In this case study, you'll learn about the data analysis flow in Power BI, comprising five key steps: data check, data exploration, data analysis & visualization, dashboard creation, and insight communication. Through practical exercises, you'll understand how to apply these steps to analyze and mitigate customer churn effectively.

## The Problem

Customer churn is a significant issue for many companies. In this case study, you'll use a churn dataset from Databel to analyze why customers are leaving the telecom provider. As a consultant hired for the task, your goal is to identify patterns and insights that can help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.

## Understanding Churn

Churn, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It's crucial to understand churn because losing existing customers can impact revenue growth significantly. By calculating churn rates and analyzing churn patterns, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and sustain business growth.

## Overview

In this case study, we delve into analyzing customer churn within a fictional telecom provider named Databel. By applying data analysis techniques in Power BI, we aim to understand why customers are leaving Databel and identify strategies to reduce churn rates.

## Insights from the Analysis

After analyzing the churn dataset provided by Databel, we gained several insights:

### General Insights
- The churn rate for Databel is approximately 27%.
- Around 45% of churn reasons are related to competitors.
- The churn rate varies significantly across different states, with California (CA) exhibiting a churn rate exceeding 60%.

### Churn Rate by Age
- Senior citizens have a churn rate 10% higher than the average (38.22%).
- The churn rate generally increases across age brackets.

### Churn Rate by Contract
- Contracts with 6 customers in a group have the lowest churn rate at 23%.
- Customers with monthly-based contracts churn more compared to those with yearly-based contracts.

### Churn Rate by Data Plan Use
- Contrary to the hypothesis, customers on unlimited data plans are more likely to churn.
- Customers with unlimited plans and consume less than 5GB of data exhibit the highest churn rate.

### Churn Rate by International Activity
- In California, 72% of customers make international calls without an international plan, indicating a potential area for improvement.

### Churn Rate by Customer Service
- Customers with monthly contracts paying by direct debit make an average of 1.47 calls per customer, with a churn rate around 54%.

## Business Plans

Based on our findings, we propose the following business plans for Databel:
1. **Promotion for International Plans**: Target customers on international plans who have not utilized international calls and propose a downgrade to a cheaper plan, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and retention.
2. **Payment Method Investigation**: Investigate payment issues for customers with direct debit payment methods to address potential payment-related churn factors.
